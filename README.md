# Simple Keylogger

This is a basic keylogger program written in Python. It captures keystrokes and logs them to a file. This project is part of the internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

## Features

- Logs each keystroke to a file named `key_log.txt`.
- Uses the `pynput` library to capture keyboard events.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Nabeelkallan/PRODIGY_CS_04.git
   cd PRODIGY_CS_04
   
Install the required dependencies:
pip install pynput

Usage
Run the script using Python:
python keylogger.py

The program will start logging keystrokes to key_log.txt in the same directory.
